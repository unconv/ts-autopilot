## TS-AutoPilot

This is a coding autopilot project I'm working on, which is based on my [GPT-AutoPilot](https://github.com/unconv/gpt-autopilot) project. It creates full codebases from a single prompt to an LLM.

The difference between this one and GPT-AutoPilot is that this one won't use function calling. This way it should be easy to use with other LLM's than ChatGPT. It should also make it easy to fine-tune a model for it.

This is my first ever TypeScript project

## Quick Start
```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
$ npm run run
```
